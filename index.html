            Hardware
          </div>
          <br>Technology using cooling plates (dehumidifier) was selected to harvest AW. Custom components were designed in Fusion 360 and 3D printed using plant-based PLA filament. The WASP system is composed of UV-LED lights, a peristaltic pump, an Adafruit pyPortal Titano IoT device, a soil moisture sensor, and a Savinder dehumidifier for harvesting atmospheric water.

            Software
          </div>
          <br>A microcomputer called the pyPortal Titano was programmed in Circuit Python to regulate soil moisture and light exposure by controlling the parastaltic pump and UV LED lights. It provides users with a GUI that enables them to select predefined values for moisture and light levels, as well as the ability to customize their own profile.

            Power
          </div>
          <br>Project WASP was powered by solar energy, which was generated by two solar panels. These panels were connected to a solar charge controller that regulated the incoming voltage. The charger controller recharged a 12V lead acid battery, which supplied power to all the electrical components of Project WASP, including the pyPortal Titano, UV lights, and the Savinder dehumidifier.

          Plant height (an important indicator of plant growth*) was measured at the start of the experiment and after 2 months. The difference in plant heights was used to estimate plant growth. The average difference in plant height was calculated for each trial, and the mean height differences between trials 1 & 2 and trials 1 & 3 were compared using a 2-tailed Student's t-test, assuming unequal variances. Significance was defined as p < 0.05.

The cost to construct one planter is $388, and the cost per planter at scale is $129. The system consumes 0.84 kWh/day per plant.
